# React Web App with Counter, Form, and Rich Text Editor

## Description
This is a full-stack web application built with React, Material-UI, and other technologies. It includes three main components: a counter with dynamic background, a user data form, and a rich text editor. The app also implements routing, user authentication, and persistence of data.

## Features
- **Counter Component**: Allows increment, decrement, and reset operations, with dynamic background changes using Bezier curves.
- **User Data Form**: Form for capturing user details (name, address, email, phone) with local storage saving and an unsaved changes prompt.
- **Rich Text Editor**: A fully functional editor for visualizing and editing text data with basic formatting options (bold, italic, underline).
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and private route access with mock authentication.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Not used in this version, but can be extended for backend integrations.
- **Authentication**: Mock Google Sign-In (or other method)
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage for form data, React state management for components
